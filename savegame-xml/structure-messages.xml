However, there are signs that this status may not last much longer. Political Analyst, Dal Buster, spoke to us today on this subject.[\012][\012]&quot;It's an open secret that many factions include loud voices clamouring for them to claim Heretic's End. The Argon in particular have a very vocal movement that sees the sector as an essential security buffer, that is forever at risk - but the Argon are not the only ones eyeing the possibilities there&quot;.[\012][\012]&quot;So far cooler heads have prevailed, but there's no treaty protecting the area, only widespread mutual trepidation regarding the potential consequences. One thing is certain, however; Heretic's End's status can no longer be taken for granted. It's only a matter of time before someone takes over the system, whether that be an established power or an upstart newcomer&quot;.[\012][\012]GalNet can only concur with Buster's analysis on this point.

Recycling is a niche, which the Riptide Rakers were all too glad to fill once they realised that they were the only ones in the position to do so efficiently and on a large scale. They appear to have overestimated their own capabilities, however, as several stations which failed to turn a profit, and were therefore not able to afford station upkeep, have recently been decommissioned permanently.

    <entry time="748505.759" id="107" highpriority="1" title="On Jump Gates - Second Draft" text="Hello everyone![\012][\012]Expedition leader Numanckaret has asked me to put in writing my thoughts on the Jump Gate opening in Heretic's End, which, I confess, has unnerved me. I am preparing a summary of the scientific debates so far, for the expedition's final report. You, my fellow explorers, get to review my latest draft. So, please tell me if any of these talking points are overly tangential or sleep-inducing![\012][\012]----------[\012][\012]First, a word on the general public discourse: signs of activity in Heretic's End, coming so soon after a communication from Kingdom End explicitly mentioning Jump Gate experiments, were met with widespread optimism. Media outlets across the Gate network gravitated towards the rather unscientific notion that the Boron were the only missing members of the pre-Dark era Community of Planets. Purely by a process of elimination, they assumed it had to be them on the other side of this Jump Gate.[\012][\012]At the other end of the spectrum, doomsday prophecies proliferated. Permanckress, one of Sacred Relic's more controversial figures, famously presented socio-mathematical calculations in an effort to &quot;prove&quot; that the collapse of Boron society had inevitably occurred mere months after the bespoke messenger drone's dispatch. According to his followers, we may well be listening to the calls of a long-dead, or at the very least economically depleted, civilisation.[\012][\012]&quot;In all probability&quot;, Permanckress asserts, the Boron would not be in a position to start a Jump Gate experiment, send a messenger drone, and almost perfectly synchronise the successful conclusion of the experiment with the arrival of the drone, years later. This would be a vanishingly unlikely coincidence, and he suggests that the massive investment in Jump Gate research required would, in itself, catalyse Boron economic collapse.[\012][\012]Permanckress' most vocal opponent, Sibasomos Sissandras Lalundas II, on the other hand, has attempted to sway the discourse by characterising the Queendom of Boron as an exceptionally stable society, profoundly focused on technological advancement. If she is to be believed, Boron technology might not have advanced to the point of Jump Gate manipulation, yet may have triggered an interference signal strong enough to prompt a cascading reaction, ultimately reaching Heretic's End itself. Permanckress retorted that the only &quot;cascading reaction&quot; would have been the complete annihilation of Boron life due to a failsafe installed by the Gate's builders.[\012][\012]This remark was clearly a reference to Sihoban Tiago, former professor of the New Hewa Academy of Sciences, who, before her recent retirement, made waves with similar speculations about an omniscient observer monitoring technological progress. In one famous lecture, originally intended to cover the life cycle of magnetars, she claimed that &quot;science is dead&quot; and further discoveries are purely at the whim of unseen forces.[\012][\012]Evidence appears to support the theory that Jump Gate interference is indeed ultimately impossible. During the Dark, several sectors drained vast resources in futile attempts to end their isolation, in some cases triggering economic, political and social collapse sufficient to render them surface-bound. Since then, the dream of reactivating Jump Gates, especially to reconnect with lost sections of one's own civilisation, has defined countless scientific careers.[\012][\012]A glimmer of hope remains. The incredibly small amount of data from the Jump Gate nacelle that we have so far been able to access, has been theorised to be some kind of &quot;cache&quot; for remote access. For the Heretic's End Jump Gate, this cached data lists among its entries the coordinates of Kingdom End. Granted, so do at least 17 other Gates in the known network, but Watchful Gaze is the first successful confirmation of a coordinate data-sync between pre- and post-Gate opening nacelle cache readings. It seems reasonable to hypothesise that this coordinate data constitutes an affinity for other Jump Gates, either because the Gates were once connected in the distant past, or because the Gate builders, in their time, made a careful selection of auspicious Jump Gate network layouts. The logic behind the prioritisation of this cached data will have to be further investigated, by observing future Jump Gate connections.[\012][\012]Rick Feynman famously postulated that &quot;one does not, by knowing and applying all fundamental laws as they are known today, gain any understanding of the Jump Gates&quot;. In this spirit, I infer from our findings the necessity of optimism. The petabytes of as yet undeciphered data within the nacelles are barely touched, and there is a distinct possibility that one of the Jump Gates ahead will add another breadcrumb on our trail to Kingdom End![\012][\012]----------[\012][\012]How's THAT for an ending!?

The gate's potential was confirmed by reading its cache which, while only allowing an incomplete reading, indicates a possible connection to Kingdom End.[\012][\012]With the assistance of the local administration, we are currently procuring the building materials required to begin construction on a Gate Link Terminal, an elaborate support infrastructure which will allow us broader access to the gate's mechanisms. It will also be used to funnel energy into the gate when we attempt to force an activation.[\012][\012]The blueprints for this terminal were supplied to us by our Kingdom End allies, but we will still need to conduct a series of tests to ensure that everything operates as expected. It is also not yet clear exactly how much energy needs to be supplied. Our scientists have a rough idea, but we do not know whether the required amount of energy is impacted by the supply on the Kingdom End side, or indeed whether the Boron on the other side have already covered some of the demand. Either way we expect the limited communication and immense energy requirements to present a challenge going forward.[\012][\012]As well as ensuring that these requirements are met, our experts have also begun the arduous task of decrypting the data that our team was able to read from the gate's cache. With the help of that recovered data, we expect to eventually be able to home in on the Kingdom End system's positional data, but we will still have to verify these coordinates independently.[\012][\012]Although all of this presents a significant challenge, our biggest obstacle is our inability to interface with the gate's operating system. Over the decades, many attempts have been made, but so far every one has drawn a blank. We are missing that one elusive variable; some sort of key to activate the system. While we have clear ideas on how to tackle all of the other obstacles, this one remains the most puzzling, and I suspect that overcoming it could well take several more decades.[\012][\012]Considering all of this, we expect to be able to begin our initial round of experiments in about four years, and to adjust our timeline according to the results.[\012][\012]In the meantime, with a safe path through Sanctuary of Darkness now established, we welcome anyone who wants to visit the Wayfinder in order to check on our progress.

First of all, I wish to take a moment to congratulate everyone who was involved in seeing this expedition through to completion. Your contributions were invaluable.[\012][\012]Ever since we made contact, our science team has been in constant communication with the scientists of Kingdom End. Comparing our notes, here is what we can say with near certainty:[\012][\012]To make an activation possible, you require two inactive but compatible gates. Compatibility can be verified by reading the gates' caches. This can pose the first challenge, since these datasets tend to be incomplete and encrypted in various ways.[\012][\012]Furthermore, an activation requires a large amount of energy. Interestingly, however, that energy does not need to be supplied to both sides of the gate pairing equally. Luckily, Kingdom End provided the vast majority of the energy for our experiment. In order to actually activate the gate, you have to introduce a particular sort of signal to home in on the selected destination. We do not know whether that signal is derived from stellar phenomena, as a sort of navigational constant, or whether it is intended as some kind of passcode. We are also unsure if this signal will work on all gates, or if there are different ciphers for different gates. Further investigation is obviously necessary.[\012][\012]Finally, we do expect that others will pick up on what we have learnt. We have already put together a more in-depth report that we intend to share with our allies, in confidence. It is also of crucial importance that we share this revelation with as many of our lost colonies as possible. As you are all aware, however, messenger drones are not a secure means of communication. Inevitably this information will spread amongst hostile factions. While the level of possible manipulation seems to be very limited, and requires immense amounts of coordination and resources, it is my expectation that we will see attempts to replicate our success by various factions in the years to come.[\012][\012]Be proud, and take a moment to reflect on the implications of what we have achieved.[\012][\012]Numanckaret[\012]-Commanding Officer of the Wayfinder Expedition" source="Numanckaret"/>
