Until recently, I was employed as head of Research and Development at Jinko-Tekina Technologies, the industry-leading ship manufacturing company. While working on their ship designs, in my free time and using company resources, I also pioneered a new kind of experimental on-board computer: a sentient machine, able not only to interpret information, but also to predict it, and to learn. A computer able to feel empathy and appreciate arts, to be self-aware and sapient.[\012]Think of the effects such a computer, with a personality, could have on the crew, too. No more need for dangerous missions to be manned. Lone pilots would have someone they could talk to on those long delivery runs... It would have changed everything. But alas, my superiors grew restless when progress temporarily stalled on my other projects, and things escalated when they became aware of what I was pursuing. They didn't believe I could actually pull it off, but still, they didn't want their brand to be associated with A.I. Research, and some board members even became scared, and voiced ethical concerns. How very narrow-minded of them. I was this close to success, but they fired me, and in doing so cut off all of my funding.[\012]However, I was able to smuggle out most of my research and various company resources with me when I left. Now, stranded on this wharf, I intend to finish what I started, and change the universe forever, for the better.[\012]I just need some technical parts to finish my work, but I can't acquire them myself for fear of leaving my project unguarded. They are fairly common processing units, you should be able to find them attached to... well, Xenon ships. If you bring me what I need, not only will I pay you for your work, but you'll be remembered in history as the person who made it all happen!" icon="briefing_corin_king_01" faction="civilian" type="deliver" level="easy" reward="43889">
